# About Me
My name is Ariel Israel. Welcome to my Github profile.

I am currently enrolled at Georgia Tech's Master of Science in Analytics program.
I am passionate about working with data and discovering insights to solve problems.
My toolbox currently includes Python, R and SQL. However, I am always open to exploring new tools that may prove to be the optimal choice for the task at hand.
